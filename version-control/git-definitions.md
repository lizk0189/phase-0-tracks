# Git Definitions

**Instructions:** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful? ffffff

Version control refers to keeping one master file while creating copies of the master that can be edited by different users. It is useful because it allows users to go back and look at the revision history of the project and catch bugs if necessary.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is essentially a copy of the master file that you can edit. It is useful because it allows you to work on the project without making changes directly to the master file.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a save point. A good commit message is descriptive and describes the work that was done since the last commit.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is when there are multiple changes and git doesn't know which of those changes should be included in the final merge.
