<h1>Life in Chicago</h1>
The weather in Chicago is <strong> very </strong> unpredictable. The running joke is that you can experience all four seasons in one day! The seasons are:
<ul> <li> Winter </li> <li> Spring </li> <li> Summer </li> <li> Fall </li>
</ul>
<h2> The <em> top </em> reasons I love living in Chicago are: </h2>
  <ol> <li> There is a lot to do. </li> <li> The people are (generally) pretty friendly. </li> <li> The food is excellent. </li> <li> It is easy to get to different parts of the country because it is centrally located. </li> </ol>
